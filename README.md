🚀 Vendoris – Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Marketplace

Vendoris is a full-stack multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace built with Laravel, Inertia.js, React (TypeScript), TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, FilamentPHP, and Stripe for secure online payments.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop modern, scalable full-stack applications where Laravel + Inertia.js power server-driven pages with the reactivity of a single-page app.

✨ Features

🔑 Role-based Access – Admin, Vendors, and Customers with secure authentication & authorization.

🛍️ Multi-Vendor Marketplace – Vendors can create stores, manage products, and track sales.

🎨 Modern UI/UX – TailwindCSS + DaisyUI for a clean, responsive design.

⚡ Dynamic Admin Panel – Built with FilamentPHP for efficient resource management.

💳 Stripe Integration – Safe and secure online payments.

📦 Order & Inventory Management – Complete shopping workflow.

🌍 Scalable Full-Stack Setup – Laravel + Inertia.js with React/TypeScript (server-rendered pages with client-like reactivity; no separate REST API required).
